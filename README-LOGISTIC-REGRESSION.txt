#READ ME FILE FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION IMPLEMENTAION:
#SAVE THE FILE 'LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-IMPLEMENTATION-TEAM-SOHATO' ON YOUR PC 
#EXECUTE THE SCRIPT IN INCREASING ORDER AND SOME BASIC DISCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS
#THE CODE IS THROUGHLY COMMENTED 
#FOR FIRST TRIAL THE ENTIRE DATASET HAS TO BE READ WHICH WILL TAKE AROUND 20-25 MIN
#AFTER WE CONVERT TO CSR OUR CODE IS RUNNING VERY FAST AND MAKING PREDICTIONS REALLY QUICK DEPENDING UPON THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS.

#AFTER WHEN THE DATA IS PREPARED RUN THE FUNCTIONS IN FOLLOWING ORDER:

1.weights():INTITIALIZE
2.norml(mtx):NORMALIZE
3.probX(W,sparse_mtx):FIND PROBABILITY
4.delta(y, unique_classes):DELTA MATRIX
5.weight=training(sparse_mtx): TRIANING FUNCTION
#weight WILL HAVE THE TRAINED WEIGHTS FROM THE TRAINING DATA.

#TRAINING FUNCTION TAKES TIME DEPENDING UPON THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS
#CHANGE VALUES FOR PENALTY, LEARNING-RATE , ITERATIONS IN training function 

6.coltest= testfunction(sparse_mtx) 
#THIS WILL RETURN THE PREDICTED CLASSES FROM LOGISTIC REGRESSION 
7.ADD 1 TO coltest

8. SAVE INTO CSV AND TEST THE ACCURACY.
